    <h1> Resources and Development </h1>
    <h2> Chapter 1 </h2>
 
    <p id = "fontButton"> 
        Can you identify and name the various items used in making life comfortable
        in our villages and towns. List the items and name the material used in their
        making. <br/> Everything available in our environment which can be used to
        satisfy our needs, provided, it is technologically accessible, economically
        feasible and culturally acceptable can be termed as Resource. <br>
        The process of transformation of things available in our environment
        involves an inter&#x2011;dependent relationship between nature, technology and
        institutions. <br/>
        Human beings interact with nature through technology and create institutions
        to accelerate their economic development. Do you think that resources are free
        gifts of nature as is assumed by many? They are not. Resources are a function
        of human activities. Human beings themselves are essential components of
        resources. They transform material available in our environment into resources
        and use them. These resources can be classified in the following ways &#x2011;
        <br> (a) On the basis of origin &#x2011; biotic and abiotic <br> (b) On the
        basis of exhaustibility &#x2011; renewable and non-renewable <br> (c) On the
        basis of ownership &#x2011; individual, community, national and international
        <br> (d) On the basis of status of development &#x2011; potential, developed
        stock and reserves
    </p>

    <h2> Types Of Resources </h2>

    <p id = "fontButton">
        <strong>On the Basis of Origin Biotic Resources</strong> <br> These
        are obtained from biosphere and have life such as human beings, flora
        and fauna, fisheries, livestock etc. <br>Abiotic Resources: All those
        things which are composed of non-living things are called abiotic
        resources. For example, rocks and metals.  <br/> <strong>On the
        Basis of Exhaustibility</strong> <br> Renewable Resources: The
        resources which can be renewed or reproduced by physical, chemical or
        mechanical processes are known as renewable or replenishable
        resources. For example, solar and wind energy, water, forests and
        wildlife, etc. The renewable resource may further be divided into
        continuous or flow. <br> Non-Renewable Resources: These occur over
        a very long geological time. Minerals and fossil fuels are  examples
        of such resources. These resources take millions of years in their
        formation. Some of the  resources like metals are recyclable and some
        like  fossil fuels cannot be recycled and get exhausted with their
        use.
